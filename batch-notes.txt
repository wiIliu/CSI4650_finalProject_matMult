Small Batch Size (Batch Size: 1)
- For a batch size of 1, using multiple threads (either 2 or 4 threads) results in slower execution than the single-threaded version. This is likely because the overhead of managing multiple threads outweighs the benefit of parallelization for such a small problem. The matrix multiplication task is simply too small to benefit from multi-threading in this case.

Moderate Batch Size (Batch Size: 10)
- For a batch size of 10, we again see that multi-threading does not provide a significant performance improvement, and in some cases (2 threads), it actually makes the computation slower. However, with 4 threads, the performance is slightly better than with single-threading, but the improvement is marginal. This suggests that while the problem size is larger than for batch size 1, it may still not be large enough to fully benefit from multi-threading.

Larger Batch Size (Batch Size: 50)
- As the batch size increases, we begin to see a more noticeable reduction in execution time with multi-threading. Using 4 threads results in a minor improvement over the single-threaded approach. The performance gain is small but still noticeable. The larger batch is now big enough that parallelizing the work across multiple threads starts to show some benefit.

Even Larger Batch Size (Batch Size: 100)
- At batch size 100, the multi-threaded performance again shows a mix of results. The 2-thread configuration provides a slight speedup compared to single-threading, while the 4-thread version is slightly slower than both single-threaded and 2-threaded approaches. This could be due to thread contention or overhead in managing too many threads. This behavior suggests that increasing threads beyond a certain point can lead to diminishing returns or even performance degradation.

Very Large Batch Size (Batch Size: 500)
- At batch size 500, the multi-threaded configurations (2 threads and 4 threads) offer a small but measurable improvement over single-threaded execution. The reduction in time, though small, suggests that multi-threading can be beneficial at larger batch sizes. However, the gain in performance is still marginal and likely to be limited by factors such as memory bandwidth, cache, or the ability to parallelize the workload efficiently.


- Batch size 1 and 10 do not benefit from multi-threading and may actually perform worse than single-threaded due to overhead.
- Batch size 50 and beyond see a more noticeable benefit from multi-threading, especially at 2 threads, although the improvement is still relatively modest.


Performance Degradation with 4 Threads: As the number of threads increases beyond a certain point (e.g., from 2 to 4), the overhead of managing those threads can outweigh the parallelization benefits, leading to slower performance. This is especially noticeable at batch sizes like 100.

The improvement in performance for multi-threading is relatively small compared to single-threaded execution, even as the batch size increases. This suggests that the algorithm is not fully optimized for parallel execution, or that the hardware (CPU cores, memory, etc.) limits the effectiveness of additional threads.
